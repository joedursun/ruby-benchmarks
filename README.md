ruby-benchmarks
===============

At the bottom of each file there is an example of the output of the benchmarks (on MRI Ruby 2.1.1 unless otherwise stated). Times may vary each time you run them and of course will vary across different Ruby interpreters/versions.

The goal of this repo is to provide information about the performance of various methods that are commonly used. Readability, ease of modification, etc. are also important factors in writing software, so I don't endorse always using the fastest operation.
